# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Booking Simulator (FastAPI + Streamlit + SQLite)

This project implements a full-stack flight reservation simulator, focusing on robust backend transactional logic, dynamic pricing algorithms, and concurrent seat management. It was developed to meet the requirements of a multi-week internship milestone project.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

* **Milestone 1 (Database Foundation):** Implemented a clean SQL schema for flights, bookings, and users.
* **Milestone 2 (Dynamic API & Pricing Engine):** Built a REST API using FastAPI and integrated a real-time dynamic pricing model based on seat availability, demand simulation, and a time factor.
* **Milestone 3 (Transactional Workflow):** Developed a concurrency-safe booking endpoint using atomic database transactions (PNR generation, seat decrement) and implemented PDF ticket generation for confirmation.
* **Frontend:** A responsive Streamlit application for searching, booking, and user authentication, simulating a modern flight booking experience.
