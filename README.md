# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Booking Simulator (FastAPI + Streamlit + SQLite)

This project implements a full-stack flight reservation simulator, focusing on robust backend transactional logic, dynamic pricing algorithms, and concurrent seat management. It was developed to meet the requirements of a multi-week internship milestone project.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

* **Milestone 1 (Database Foundation):** Implemented a clean SQL schema for flights, bookings, and users.
* **Milestone 2 (Dynamic API & Pricing Engine):** Built a REST API using FastAPI and integrated a real-time dynamic pricing model based on seat availability, demand simulation, and a time factor.
* **Milestone 3 (Transactional Workflow):** Developed a concurrency-safe booking endpoint using atomic database transactions (PNR generation, seat decrement) and implemented PDF ticket generation for confirmation.
* **Frontend:** A responsive Streamlit application for searching, booking, and user authentication, simulating a modern flight booking experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend API** | **FastAPI** | High-performance, asynchronous web framework (Python). |
| **Database** | **SQLite** | Simple, file-based SQL database for local persistence. |
| **Frontend UI** | **Streamlit** | Fast application development framework for the web interface. |
| **Pricing/Tasks** | **APScheduler** | Handles the background job for simulating demand changes. |
| **PDF Generation** | **ReportLab** | Library used to structure and generate the e-ticket PDF. |

Milestone/Task,Requirement,Status,Implementation Location
M1: Foundational Database,Design & implement schema; Populate data.,Complete,db.sql and initialized via initialize_db.py.
"M2, T1: Retrieval/Searching",Retrieve all flights; Search by Origin/Destination.,Complete,/flights/all and /flights endpoints in main.py.
"M2, T2: Validation & Sorting",Implement input validation and sorting (by price).,Complete,main.py (Pydantic & Query parameters). Frontend handles input normalization.
"M2, T3: Schedule API Simulation",Simulate external airline schedule APIs.,Complete,/airports endpoint in main.py fetches data from the DB to mimic an external source.
"M2, T4, 5: Dynamic Pricing","Design logic (seats, time, demand); Integrate into search API.",Complete,main.py (calculate_dynamic_price()) and integrated into the /flights endpoint response.
"M2, T6: Background Simulation",Build background process to simulate demand changes.,Complete,main.py uses APScheduler to periodically update the demand_factor in the database.
M3: Concurrency Control,Implement concurrency safety (seat reservation).,Complete,/bookings POST endpoint uses SQLite database transactions for atomicity.
M3: PNR & Confirmation,Generate unique PNR; Simulated payment/confirmation.,Complete,/bookings POST generates PNR and commits; /tickets/{pnr} generates downloadable PDF.
M3: Cancellation/History,Build booking cancellation endpoint.,Complete,DELETE /bookings/{pnr} endpoint restores the seat count.
## üöÄ How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the simulator on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `git` (optional, for cloning the repo)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Set Up Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/flight-booking-simulator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/flight-booking-simulator.git)
cd flight-booking-simulator

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Initialize the Database
The database file (db.sqlite) must be created and populated with the initial schema and 175 sample flights.

Bash

python initialize_db.py
Step 4: Start the FastAPI Backend (Server)
Open your first terminal window, ensure the venv is active, and start the FastAPI application. This server handles all data and logic.

Bash

# Terminal 1: Start the Backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
(The backend will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Step 5: Start the Streamlit Frontend (Client)
Open a second terminal window, ensure the venv is active, and start the Streamlit UI.

Bash

# Terminal 2: Start the Frontend
streamlit run frontend.py
(The UI will open automatically in your browser, typically at http://localhost:8501)
