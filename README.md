# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Booking Simulator (FastAPI + Streamlit + SQLite)

This project implements a full-stack flight reservation simulator, focusing on robust backend transactional logic, dynamic pricing algorithms, and concurrent seat management. It was developed to meet the requirements of a multi-week internship milestone project.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

* **Milestone 1 (Database Foundation):** Implemented a clean SQL schema for flights, bookings, and users.
* **Milestone 2 (Dynamic API & Pricing Engine):** Built a REST API using FastAPI and integrated a real-time dynamic pricing model based on seat availability, demand simulation, and a time factor.
* **Milestone 3 (Transactional Workflow):** Developed a concurrency-safe booking endpoint using atomic database transactions (PNR generation, seat decrement) and implemented PDF ticket generation for confirmation.
* **Milestone 4 (Frontend):** A responsive Streamlit application for searching, booking, and user authentication, simulating a modern flight booking experience.

## üìã Milestone Implementation Breakdown

This table details the fulfillment of all project requirements across the four milestones, providing a clear map of functionality within the codebase.

| Milestone/Module | Task/Requirement | Status | Implementation Details (File & Function) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **M1: Foundational Database** | Design & implement schema; Populate data (Flights, Users, Bookings). | Complete | **`db.sql`** defines the finalized schema (City/Country names, Status, Passenger Name). |
| **M2: Dynamic API & Pricing** | Retrieve/Search flights; Input Validation & Sorting; Dynamic Pricing Logic. | Complete | **`main.py`**: `/flights` endpoints integrate `calculate_dynamic_price()`. **`frontend.py`** uses auto-filtering search input. |
| **M2, T6: Background Simulation** | Build background process to simulate demand/availability changes. | Complete | **`main.py`**: **APScheduler** runs `update_demand_factor()` to simulate market shifts. |
| **M3: Transaction Management** | **Concurrency Control** (PNR/Seat safety); Cancellation/Archival. | Complete | **`main.py`**: `/bookings` uses **SQLite transactions** for atomic seat reservation. **`DELETE /bookings`** archives records and generates refund receipts. |
| **M4: UI & API Integration (Final Delivery)** | **Design UI/Integrate all APIs; Display dynamic prices; Multi-step flow; Final polish.** | Complete | **Frontend (`frontend.py`):** Built using **Streamlit** (cohesive UI, Gen-Z aesthetic, State Management). **Seamless Integration** across all `/flights`, `/bookings`, and `/chat` APIs. |
| **M4 Output** | Fully functional frontend; Seamless integration; Booking confirmation receipts; Usable experience. | Delivered | Confirmation receipts (tickets/cancellation) generated by **ReportLab** and served via `FileResponse` endpoints. AI Chatbot integrated for enhanced UX. |

---## üöÄ How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the simulator on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `git` (optional, for cloning the repo)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Set Up Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [[https://github.com/YourUsername/flight-booking-simulator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/flight-booking-simulator.git)](https://github.com/zayn-codes/Flight-Booking-Simulator-Dynamic_Pricing-.git)
cd flight-booking-simulator

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Initialize the Database
The database file (db.sqlite) must be created and populated with the initial schema and 175 sample flights.

python initialize_db.py
Step 4: Start the FastAPI Backend (Server)
Open your first terminal window, ensure the venv is active, and start the FastAPI application. This server handles all data and logic.

# Terminal 1: Start the Backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
(The backend will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Step 5: Start the Streamlit Frontend (Client)
Open a second terminal window, ensure the venv is active, and start the Streamlit UI.

# Terminal 2: Start the Frontend
streamlit run frontend.py
(The UI will open automatically in your browser, typically at http://localhost:8501)
